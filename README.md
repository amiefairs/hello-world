Practice repository from the GitHub guide

This is a practice file from the GitHib guide, and it tells me to write about myself, so why not?
My name is Amie, and I'm learning GitHub so that I can effectively work on my open project with Daniela Saderi. I've never used GitHub before though I have heard of it, and I know it is commonly used. My officemate tells me it's pretty simple to work with so fingers crossed I don't muck this up! :)
